Geoff Lanotte Dot Files
=======================

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

Thanks!
-------

I have run out of people to thank for this, but here is a non-exaustive list:

Ryan Bates - The initial base project, installation and many of the aliases
Robby Russel - While I don't use oh-my-zsh, I have taken many many things from there


Installation
------------

    git clone git://github.com/glanotte/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install

Prerequisites
-------------

  @tpope's Pathogen: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

Troubleshooting
---------------

  If the color schemes aren't loading when you start VIM, copy the colors subdirectory from the vim directory in this project to ~/.vim
